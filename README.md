# matrix-operation
A Python 3 program to implement the matrix operations for any 2x2 to 10x10 matrix.

## Task Specification

Create structured, commented Python 3 code to implement the matrix operations above for any
3 × 3 matrix.

Additionally, the minimum specification below must be met:

* be console/text-based
* use nested lists and loops
* include user defined functions
* provide a basic menu system to allow the user to:
    * Enter and store the data for a 3 × 3 matrix
    * Find and display the sum of two 3 × 3 matrices
    * Find and display the scalar product of a 3 × 3 matrix
    * Find and display the product of two 3 × 3 matrices
    * Exit the program in a controlled manner
* all code must be appropriately commented

The task can be broken down as follows:
1. Create structured, commented Python 3 code to implement the matrix operation algorithms to
the given specification.
2. Conduct appropriate testing to ensure your code works for any 3 × 3 matrix.
3. Write a technical document using the LaTeX template provided, which explains the operation of
your code, and which includes your code listing as an appendix.
